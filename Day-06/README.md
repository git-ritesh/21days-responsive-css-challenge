# Day-06 | Review 

In this first week, we've looked at:

  -  Using percentages for widths
  -  Avoiding to set heights
  -  Using max-width


While there is nothing overly complicated with any of that, being comfortable with these things is the key to mastering responsive layouts.

With a good understanding of the above, all we need is a little flexbox and we're going to start knocking even complex layouts out of the park!

In this section of the course, you can find a few links to some extra reading that you can do if you're looking to continue learning a bit. They'll help supplement what we're covering here, but none of it is required reading ðŸ˜Š.

I'll be sharing my solution to the challenge tomorrow. If you're a little bit behind at this point, you can use today and tomorrow to catch up a little.

Next week, we'll be jumping into flexbox and how we can use it with what we've already learned to make our layouts. We'll be looking at both the macro-scale with a page's layout, as well as the more micro-scale in putting together a common navbar component.

## A Tale of width and max-width

### Read this [article](https://css-tricks.com/tale-width-max-width/) to know more about these two properties.

An interesting look at the two properties, and how they might not always act the way you think they will. 

As it says, the second one is the easier one to understand, just like we looked at, so I plan on sticking with that one ðŸ˜Š
