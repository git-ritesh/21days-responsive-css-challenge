# Day-10 | Extra Curricular Activites
Yesterday was a big day, so there is no shame in taking a break at this point!

If you're loving flexbox (or perhaps still a little confused by it!), I do have a 3-part series on YouTube that goes much deeper than we've looked so far, and could help you grasp it.

You can find it here: [Flebox Basics by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4-IK0AVhVjMSb9c06AjRlTpvxL3otpUd)

You can also read the notes of the each tutorial which i've prepared with illustrations for clear understanding with codes as well.

You won't need this to complete any of the challenges in the course and a lot of it will be covered in the coming days, but if you really want some more material today, really understanding flexbox is a good place to start.
