# Em vs Rem 

## Em (Relative)

- If you're using a font size using EMs it will be in relation to that elements parent. 
- `1em` generally defaults to `16px` (pixels) if the parent doesn't have a font size.
- In EMs the font sizes are compounding on top of each other. i.e. _if there's a div whose font size is `1em` i.e `16px` if we put a child into the parent div and specify the font size as `2em` then it becomes `2 * 16px`(parent's) i.e. `32px` and so on and so forth._
- `font-size` is always looking at the parent but the `margin`, `padding`, `width` and any other unit of the element is looking at the element's own `font-size. `

## Rem (Consistent)
- According to mozilla developer network _Rems were actually invented with the sole purpose of fixing that whole compounding problem_ we just see in Em.
- Rem stands for **root M**
- Rem looks at the HTML elements font size and not the body. 
- Rem is always consistent it's always looking at what the font size of HTML element is whereas EMs are more variable the font-size looks at the parent and all the other properties we can apply looks at the font-size of that element
