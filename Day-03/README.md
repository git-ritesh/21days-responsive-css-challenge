# Day 03 | Enter max-width

_As we saw setting a fixed width on an element tends to be a bad idea. Instead we can use `% `(percentages), which makes our lives easier._


The only issue with this is, _at large screens, things can get too big_. Thankfully, we have [max-width](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_max-width.php) that can help us out!
