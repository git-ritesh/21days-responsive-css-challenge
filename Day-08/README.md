# Day-08 | Flexbox Basics

Flexbox was the first actual layout property given to us in CSS, which is wild because it was only added relatively recently.

This part of the course isn't a complete overview of flexbox, but more of a look at how we can quickly and easily use it to start making more interesting looking layouts.

We'll be starting with some simple columns setups, plus a nice trick to space things out. In the coming days, we'll be diving deeper in and making more fleshed out layouts.

Flexbox does do a few strange things, which we'll be exploring as well.

For the challenge, I've provided the design specs as a PDF. I've also provided the starting files both as a download to work locally on your computer, as well as a Codepen. Pick whichever you'd prefer ðŸ˜Š

### Note : 

- `divs` by default has a `width` of `100%`. 

- flex-items always try to shrink down to the smallest possible size they can be. 

- if you add too much `divs` in a Flex container then content will overflow in the right-direction in the row. 

- Also it will shrink too much which can make the content too short and bad view experience.
