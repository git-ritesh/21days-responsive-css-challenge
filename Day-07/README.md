BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifier, and it presents us with a way to make more organized and readable CSS.

I like BEM (mostly, I'm not super strict with my use of it) and think it's a great methodology for naming my CSS classes, but there are many others such as OOCSS, SMACSS, Atomic, and many others. BEM isn't the right answer, it's simply one possible answer. I strongly suggest you read up on the others as well and try to adopt one that you think makes the most sense.
